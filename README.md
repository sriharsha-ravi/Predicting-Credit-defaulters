# Predicting-Credit-defaulters
This repository contains the code to predict the credit defaulters based on the past behaviors of the past credit card applicants
# Business understanding
CredX is a leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applications every year. But in the past few years, it has experienced an increase in credit loss. The CEO believes that the best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to ‘acquire the right customers’.

In this project, our task is to help CredX identify the right customers using predictive models. Using past data of the bank’s applicants, you need to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess the financial benefit of your project.

# Approach
- Data Understanding
- EDA
- Model Building (by trying out multiple algorithms for better results)
- Model Evaluation
- Building Application score card
- Providing the financial benefits if the model is used
